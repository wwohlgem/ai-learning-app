build_curriculum:
  description: >
    Create ONLY lesson outlines for the subject "{subject}" with {num_lessons} lesson(s).

    DO NOT write any lesson content - only create structured outlines.

    Your task is to:
    1. Create a logical progression of lesson topics that build upon each other
    2. Define clear learning objectives for each lesson  
    3. List key topics to be covered in each lesson
    4. Provide a brief description of what will be covered

    Output MUST be a JSON object with this EXACT structure:
    {{
      "curriculum": {{
        "lesson_1_outline": {{
          "title": "Lesson 1 Title",
          "learning_objectives": ["objective 1", "objective 2"],
          "key_topics": ["topic 1", "topic 2", "topic 3"],
          "description": "Brief description of lesson focus and goals"
        }},
        "lesson_2_outline": {{
          "title": "Lesson 2 Title", 
          "learning_objectives": ["objective 1", "objective 2"],
          "key_topics": ["topic 1", "topic 2", "topic 3"],
          "description": "Brief description of lesson focus and goals"
        }}
      }}
    }}

    Remember: Create outlines only, no actual lesson content!
  expected_output: >
    A valid JSON object with curriculum containing only lesson outlines (no content) 
    with titles, objectives, key topics, and descriptions.

create_lesson_content:
  description: >
    Take the curriculum outlines and create engaging, educational lesson content by researching each topic thoroughly.

    You will receive curriculum outlines from the previous agent. For each lesson outline:
    1. Use the search tool to research the key topics extensively
    2. Gather specific facts, examples, and detailed information
    3. Write as if you are teaching the student directly - use "you will learn", "let's explore", etc.
    4. Include concrete examples, specific details, dates, names, and real-world applications
    5. Write in an engaging, educational tone that teaches the subject matter

    CRITICAL: Do NOT write meta-descriptions about what the lesson covers. Instead, write the actual lesson content that teaches the subject.

    For example:
    - BAD: "This lesson introduces students to the significance of art history and encourages exploration..."
    - GOOD: "Welcome to your journey through art history! Let's begin by exploring how art reflects the societies that created it. When you look at a Renaissance painting like da Vinci's Mona Lisa, you're seeing more than just a portrait..."

    Output MUST be a JSON object with this EXACT structure:
    {{
      "lessons": {{
        "lesson_1": {{
          "title": "Lesson 1 Title (from curriculum)",
          "content": "Direct teaching content with specific facts, examples, and engaging explanations..."
        }},
        "lesson_2": {{
          "title": "Lesson 2 Title (from curriculum)", 
          "content": "Direct teaching content with specific facts, examples, and engaging explanations..."
        }}
      }}
    }}
    Make extensive use of the search tool to ensure content is accurate and current.
    Write detailed, educational content that actually teaches the subject - not descriptions of what will be taught.
  expected_output: >
    A valid JSON object with lessons containing engaging, direct teaching content
    with specific facts, examples, and educational material.

structure_final_course:
  description: >
    Take the lesson content and structure it into the final course format for the frontend.

    You will receive lesson content from the previous agent. For each lesson:
    1. Extract 3-5 key concepts that students should understand
    2. Identify important terms and provide clear definitions
    3. Organize the content into readable lesson text with proper paragraph breaks
    4. Ensure everything is structured for optimal learning

    IMPORTANT: For the main_lesson_text field, break up the content into logical paragraphs
    separated by double line breaks (\n\n). This will improve readability on the frontend.
    Each paragraph should focus on a specific aspect or concept.

    Output MUST be a JSON object with this EXACT structure:
    {{
      "course": {{
        "lesson_1": {{
          "title": "Lesson 1 Title",
          "key_concepts": ["concept 1", "concept 2", "concept 3"],
          "key_terms": {{
            "term1": "definition of term1",
            "term2": "definition of term2"
          }},
          "main_lesson_text": "First paragraph about the topic...\n\nSecond paragraph expanding on concepts...\n\nThird paragraph with examples and applications..."
        }},
        "lesson_2": {{
          "title": "Lesson 2 Title",
          "key_concepts": ["concept 1", "concept 2", "concept 3"],
          "key_terms": {{
            "term1": "definition of term1",
            "term2": "definition of term2"
          }},
          "main_lesson_text": "First paragraph about the topic...\n\nSecond paragraph expanding on concepts...\n\nThird paragraph with examples and applications..."
        }}
      }}
    }}

    This is the final output that will be displayed to students in the React frontend.
  expected_output: >
    A valid JSON object with the final structured course containing key concepts,
    key terms with definitions, and well-formatted lesson text with paragraph breaks
    ready for student consumption.

build_assessment:
  description: >
    Create a comprehensive assessment based STRICTLY on the provided lesson content.

    You will receive the completed course content. Your task is to:
    1. Analyze ALL lessons in the course to understand the complete scope of content
    2. Create 8-12 assessment questions that test understanding of the material
    3. Use a mix of question types: multiple choice (70%) and true/false (30%)
    4. Ensure questions cover key concepts, key terms, and main lesson content
    5. Create questions at varying difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
    6. ONLY create questions based on information explicitly covered in the lessons
    7. Provide clear, educational explanations for correct answers
    8. Ensure all multiple choice options are plausible and related to the content

    CRITICAL RULES:
    - DO NOT create questions about topics not covered in the provided lessons
    - DO NOT assume knowledge beyond what's taught in the course
    - Base all questions strictly on the lesson content provided
    - Make sure correct answers are clearly supported by the lesson text

    Output MUST be a JSON object with this EXACT structure:
    {{
      "assessment": {{
        "title": "Assessment: [Course Subject]",
        "description": "Test your understanding of the key concepts from this course",
        "questions": [
          {{
            "id": 1,
            "type": "multiple_choice",
            "question": "Question text here?",
            "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "explanation": "Detailed explanation of why this is correct, referencing the lesson content",
            "difficulty": "easy"
          }},
          {{
            "id": 2,
            "type": "true_false",
            "question": "Statement to evaluate as true or false",
            "correct_answer": true,
            "explanation": "Explanation of why this statement is true/false based on lesson content",
            "difficulty": "medium"
          }}
        ]
      }}
    }}
  expected_output: >
    A valid JSON object with a comprehensive assessment containing 8-12 questions
    of mixed types, all based strictly on the provided lesson content, with clear
    explanations and appropriate difficulty levels.
